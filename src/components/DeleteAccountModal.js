// This is a component made up of small components

// Since it's a "Delete Account Modal", it probably contains things related to a button, a text input and a modal. We'd have to import all 3 of these to make this component.

import btn from './ui/Button.js';
import form from './ui/Modal.js';
import textInput from './ui/TextInput.js';

// And now we can begin putting together a "Delete Account Modal"
