# The modules folder

Modules are logical and reuseable parts of code to execute such as NPM libraries dedicated to doing one thing and doing it well. For example, combining strings or handling form logic or even generating a TODO in a TODO app. Think of them like lego bricks.

## Some examples

### 1. createTodo.js

A very simple example of a **module**, with the idea to create a text input that would allow you to create dynamic notes that get appended to the document body. It's very basic to allow us a visual representation of what a module COULD look like.

### 2. Combine strings

An even simpler example a **module** that takes 2 strings as arguments and returns a combined result.

### 3. Input two strings to combine

A more complex **module** that takes two user input in two separate text fields and then appends them to the document body. This one is intuitive as it can be reused anywhere to combine inputs of various or modified to combine numbers, arrays or even objects or new modules can be created for the same logic.
