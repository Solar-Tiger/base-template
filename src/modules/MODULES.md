# The modules folder

A place where all root level pages a user can go to exist. These are separate based on what components need to exist. The **home** folder for instance would only contain things and coponents related to **home**

## Some examples

### 1. Home

Under the **home** folder we just have things related to it. We wouldn't need to have components that are for editing **user settings** for exmaple.

### 2. Login

Under the **login** folder we just have things related to it. We wouldn't need to have components that are for editing **user settings** or give access to the **home** page for exmaple as the user isn't logged in yet.
