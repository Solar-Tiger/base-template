# The pages folder

A place where all root level pages a user can go to exist

## Some examples

### 1. Ungrouped

Here we just have one thing unrelated to any other content. If you're not logged in, all you'll get is the login screen.

- **LoginScreen.js** for if a user is not logged in. Has no grouping

### 2. Grouped ((logged-in) folder example)

Here we have 2 things that can appear to the user IF they're logged in: a **home screen** and a **user dashboard screen**.

- **HomeScreen.js** to run a development build
- **DashboardScreen.js** to run a production build
